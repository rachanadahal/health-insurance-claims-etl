# Health Insurance Claims ETL Pipeline

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python.

## Project Structure
- `data/claims.csv` - Sample health insurance claims data
- `etl.py` - Python script that reads the CSV, transforms the data, and loads it into a SQLite database

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas`
3. Run the ETL script: `python etl.py`
4. This will create `claims.db` SQLite database with the transformed data.

## Next Steps
- Query the SQLite database using SQL
- Visualize data using Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn
- Extend ETL to handle larger datasets or multiple files
